# Next.js + Tailwind + Typescript template

Base project template using Next.js, Tailwind and Typescript.

It is barely different from the [base project in the Next.js repo](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss) as it uses:

- PurgeCSS
- Typescript's `baseUrl` and `paths`
